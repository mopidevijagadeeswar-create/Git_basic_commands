# What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system (VCS). It helps developers track changes in source code during software development.simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.

## Key Features of Git
- VERSION CONTROL: Track changes to files over time. 
- Distributed System: Every developer has a full copy of the repository.
- Branching & Merging: You can create branches for new features and merge them back.
- Staging Area: You can decide which changes to commit.
- Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project.

# How Git Works (Architecture Overview)

Git tracks changes using snapshots, not differences.
Each time you commit, Git takes a snapshot of your entire project and links it to the previous one.

🔸 The Three Git States:

Working Directory → your local files.

Staging Area (Index) → where changes are prepared for commit.

Repository (.git folder) → stores the project history.

[Working Directory] → git add → [Staging Area] → git commit → [Repository]
